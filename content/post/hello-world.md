I'm starting out this blog with a typical Hello World post. Very original, I know.

I've been thinking of starting/doing this for a while now (a couple of years actually), but I've never got around really doing it. Call it procrastination or whatever.

## General outline

This blog will include my opinions and tutorials about all things tech I have come across, from technologies I have used, to code snippets and full fledged tutorials. Hopefully someone will find it useful, if not, I definitely need a place to store and organize bits and pieces of information. However, there comes a time for everything, and the time has come for me to make a programming blog.

## Background Information

A bit of background regarding myself. I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering from The Polytechnics of Bucharest University (F.I.L.S.), I have been working in web development for over 8 years now and programming for about 17.

I like to call myself a Fullstack Web Developer. My programming language of choice is currently PHP.  I also have experience doing frontend development work (HTML, CSS, JS) and a tiny bit of devOps experience. More can be found here http://www.adigheorghe.ro

So here goes nothing!
